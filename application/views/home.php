	<!-- <h1>Hi, Welcome to <sup><h3 style="display:inline-block; margin: 0;">Th</h3></sup>INC,</h1><br>
	<h5>The Interactive Network Condense Console</h5> -->
	<h1>Hi, Welcome to X3Cams</h1><br>
	<h5>X-treme X-Rated Xperience</h5>
	<p>X3Cams is on the <sup>Th</sup>INC, platform and as you can see, is a little lacking in the areas of
	interactivity at the moment. But you are viewing the foundation for the
	first back end panel for developers and users alike. How do we plan to
	do both? I'm glad you asked. Through the use of the design elements that
	web 3.0 brought with it I'll be able to make an interactive console that
	is user friendly to the least skilled and those who have physical
	complications. But through the infrastruction comprised of multiple
	frameworks this console remains unhindered by API modules when running at
	excessive capacity. We couldn't say as much about one of the API's hosting servers,
	Sorry about that C... well, you know who you are.</p>
	<p>ThINC is the website you build for yourself. We give you a selection of premade modules
		that you'll use to populate your screen and... wait, no we don't! Find your own API'S!
		Sound complicated? Oh, you have no idea. So lets make a deal, shall we? You get the
		API, RSS/ATOM, JSON, or YAML link and ThINC will get right on that for you! If your a
		developer, ThINC knows the drill! "sit down, shut up and don't touch anything!"

	 Build custom API's in almost any websafe
	language, get the content you want. Starting off you will notice a top
	navigation and one of similar size on the bottom. That is your toolbar.
	it's pretty bare but that will change. For developers this will have your
	Terminal, linter module, connections, server information, and other useful
	items. For the standard web user, there's a better interface for your needs.
	You don't need tools for bug-stomping. but you do have work to get done
	or school to go to and for you to go without out this would be a mistake.
	<sup>Th</sup>INC is here to help you. mail in one side bar, word in
	another, research splitable in the maine view. But what about your
	social media? OH! you didn't think we left you only a single view, did you?
	you. Your social media view is designed to login  with you and recieve and
	updates updates and messages <sup>Th</sup>INC does not send messages by it's
	own ability. It doesn't actually have that ability in the first place.
	It requires a connection to facebook, google, skype, or any communications
	software. For more information please feel free to sit and wait. No one
	is on their way but you looked pretty comfy. Alternatively, you may
	look up the creator on facebook and ask them there.</p>

	<p>Ultimately the sky is the limit on here. If you have access to the data
		you can have a tool for it here without an extra tab. Are you a
		sports fan? Live twitter feeds are readily available and of course
		a live multimedia stream of the game can run in the same window. The
		only thing left is to get the online pizza order API for your favorite
		place. All without touching the address bar.</p>

developers in mind  originally. What do we never really have? If you
said a life, girlfriend, or social skills I... Ok ya, that's fair. We also never
have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and most of us are just fine with that.
