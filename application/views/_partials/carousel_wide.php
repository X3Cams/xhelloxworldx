          <!--<p>A lot of people on site's that crowd-source questions such as answers.com and Quora ask if it's accurate to take the, "Full Stack" title. This isn't even Full Stack. It's missing Design as well as some science and theoretical physics the help explain how code is being processed, it's the difference between n++ and ++n.</p> -->
          <p>Fesh coders have asked, "Am I full Stack if I can X" and my answer is, "Yes absolutly!" because everyone is a pro after 3 whole months of looking at a computer screen. If you need to hire a full stack developer, it's best to start by not using the term. It's an unofficial unregulated title that can be used by anyone regardless of merit</p>

          <h3>Full Stack?</h3>
          <p>The Full Stack title isn't just about code. A propper website usually requires a designer, back-end and front-end devs and a Database expert (depedning on back-end) but people will pay extra to work with only one person. Well... this is almost full stack, are you close?</p>
          <!--And now you're wondering what, "Stack" is. A dynamic website consists of 4 primary parts and what you choose for each is your stack. A Full Stack Dev can work with any combinations and do any job within it. But that's just the start.-->

          <h3>Are you Full Stack?</h3>
          <p>If I knew your car inside and out and I could fix it no matter what the problem was. Whould it matter to you if I knew nothing about other vehicles? I am full stack depending on who you ask. I'm between the higher standards and the lower standards.
